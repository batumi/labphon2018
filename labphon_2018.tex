As technologies such as smartphones reach remote areas, the need for
developing language technologies for smaller speaker populations has
become more pressing. In this paper, we present methodology for low resource
language documentation, and exemplify the usefulness of such techniques with a
phonetic study of prosodic variability in Georgian, a Kartvelian agglutinative
language spoken in the Caucasus Mountains on the border of Eastern Europe and
Western Asia. Used by 1.4 million speakers in the Republic of Georgia (Figure
1.) and members of the diaspora throughout the world, Georgian is an
understudied language with very limited access to software and tools (e.g. spell
checkers, electronic dictionaries and search engine tokenizers) which would
facilitate its use in written form. While Georgian is the national language of
Georgia, most computer systems sold in Georgia are offered in Russian or in
English \cite{Sh}, and because most search engines lack support for Georgian,
users perform internet searches using Russian or English keywords.

In 2014 we created open source libraries and tools to facilitate usage of the
Georgian language by Georgian speakers \cite{Du}. One of these tools was Gismet,
an Android application which can be used by Georgian speakers to train their
Android smartphones to recognize their speech using PocketSphinx \cite{Hu}. The
software was made freely available to the public and also open source on GitHub,
a social coding site where developers can share and contribute to the source
code.

Participants discover the application in the Google Play Store. After installing
it, they are led through a tutorial where they record 2-6 utterances to train
the application to their voice. The stimuli consist of two SMS dictations, two
web searches and two legal searches. Following the training phase, users can add
additional training sentences or begin using the application anywhere in the
Android system where keyboard input is provided. The training utterances are
uploaded to a central server where they are processed using Praat \cite{Bo} and
the CMUSphinx language model toolkit \cite{Wa}. The stimuli are comprised of six
utterances which were elicited during fieldwork with three speakers in Batumi,
Georgia in 2014.

Since 2014, over 1,000 users have used the application to train the default
language model to their voices. The resulting dataset of elicited
training recordings is similar to a dataset obtained in an experimental setting.
%, no user defined messages are included in the dataset.
The location of the recordings is determined via GPS technology, and informed
consent for the anonymous analysis of their voices is required as part of the
software installation process. This set-up enables us to conduct
studies regarding various aspects of their speech production. Georgian has numerous
 and diverse dialects, the phonetic variation in
the contemporaneous form of the language has not been studied, with very few
exceptions \cite{Ch, CGB}. For a first `case study' based on our corpus, we
have selected prosodic variation, specifically the realization of syllable timing
patterns in short utterances. The prosodic properties of Georgian are of
particular interest, given the ability of its consonants to form extensive
clusters \cite{Ch} combined with vowel reduction \cite{Bu}.
While the analysis of the entire corpus is underway, Figure 2. presents
spectrograms of two speakers' production of the same short question ``What is
the temperature today?,'' with distinct prosodies.
%To identify the existence of different prototypes, we apply a novel
% categorization tool based on the computation of similarity scores
% between intonation contours (following [4]).
